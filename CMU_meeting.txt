Traditional Threats:
  * Weather & Natural Disasters

Emerging Threats:
  * Physical/Cyber Attacks - Interconnection of Electricity 
    & Information Systems

Systemic Threats:
  * Extreme Cold
  * Fuel Supply issues % Global Disruptions & Trade

Non-Major events are constant - Major Events have become more frequent (weather
disasters such as Winter Storm Uri)

Recent Events:

* Battery Costs are falling and battery usage for energy storage is increasing.
  * Why? Short term event security : low prices during wind/solar generation
    periods

Transmission Queues :: Renewable addition delays to the grid.

DOE Transmission investments recently

Undergrounding Lines (burying transmission & utility lines) secures lines in
resiliency issues (preventing wildfires and ice-storm / hurricanes) 

* Cons are the difficulty of repairs and very expensive

GRID MODERNIZATION:
  * Look into cybersecurity solutions for powergrids and preventing energy
    ransom attacks.
  * Electricity route optimization and ways to save power/money/emissions.

Home energy usaged efficiency optimizations

* Make a tool to estimate risk of inefficient energy usage by a household to
  direct energy funds. (use real estate / public data of housing renovations
  - etc) 

reducing cost of energy & utilities as a right --> energy usage will be more
necessary as climate becomes more unstable and local architectures are not able
to handle variability.
