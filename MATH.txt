	* Related to Poisson process by proof of p(0; lambda * t) = e^(-lambda * t)
	* Probability of no events occuring in a variable timeframe

	Thus for random variable X defined by the exponential. 
	The probability of the time exceeding a given value is e^(-lambda * x)
	1 - Probability of time exceeding == Probability of an event occuring 
	in a given range of time
	(this is the cumulative distribution function for a given upper bound.
	Derive to find the density function lambda * e^(-lambda * x)
	(when lambda = 1/Beta) --> This becomes the exponential distribution
